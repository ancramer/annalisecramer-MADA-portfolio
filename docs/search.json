    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

    "text": "Academic Background\nFor undergrad, I attended Westfield State University in Westfield, MA (about half an hour south of UMass, if you’re familiar). My bachelors are in biotechnology and general mathematics, I did half pure and half applied math. Working in a hospital lab during the height of covid developed my interest in respiratory viruses, and completing an REU in UGA’s Odum School of Ecology fine tuned my infectious disease interests towards mathematical modeling. After graduating, I moved to Athens to begin my PhD.\nI have a strong preference for R, and I’ve used SAS for a few classes. In undergrad we used VBA/excel, but that’s not very helpful for this field. I’m a stronger mathematician than programmer, but that’s been shifting as I move through this degree program, and that’s something that I hope this course will continue to push me towards. I’ve taken the department required courses (BIOS8010, BIOS8020, BIOS8030, BIOS8200) and a handful of STAT department courses to fill out my skillset (Bayesian statistics, Time series analysis). I’m making progress on building my data analysis skills on top of my mathematical background, but there’s still plenty more to learn!\nI’ve completed several data analysis projects throughout my academic career, using data from phylogenetic sequences to survey data to case counts. I hope to get more into case count data and eventually move into forecasting. I’m hoping this course will help me gain more confidence working with data and staying organized."

I do a little day trip once or twice a month to go hiking somewhere in Northern GA/NC/TN. My all time favorite hike was with my brother in Death Valley. It’s the only place I’ve been to where there’s no encouragement to stay on the trails– the climate is so extreme, humans can’t do much damage, so we just walked across the salt flats for miles. We both preferred less busy environments, so we planned our trip for December to avoid crowds. Along the way, we found this tool that helped us plan the trip. It’s interesting to me to see the differences during 2020-2021, as well as effects of climate variation on visit counts. Additionally, the site provides visitation data sets.\nSince I’m newish to the area still, let me know your trail recommendations!\n\n\n\nMe at Charlie’s Bunion in Great Smoky Mountains NP, this past June. It was too cloudy to see the view."

Ages are 60-90, with more people in the mid to late 70s. Average BMI should be 28 for males, 30 for females. Age and BMI are slightly correlated, as age goes up, BMI slightly goes down. The study takes place over 2 years, with checkpoints every 3 months. There are 3 treatment groups, randomly assigned: placebo, 10mg, 20mg dose. Include a tumor variable that is measured in mm. Over time, the 20mg treatment group should show significant reduction in tumor size, the 10mg tumor group showing tumor staying the same size or slightly shrinking, and the placebo group can show anything in tumor size.

We can see that lower infant mortality is negatively correlated with higher life expectancy. Higher population is positively correlated with life expectancy. The data appears in “streaks” in both plots as this shows year by year data within each African country. I’ll add a second set of plots colored by country to show this more clearly.\nggplot(data=infants1, aes(x=infant_mortality, y=life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=population1, aes(x=population, y=life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_log10()\n\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=africadata, aes(x=infant_mortality, y=life_expectancy, col=country)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=africadata, aes(x=population, y=life_expectancy, col=country)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_log10()\n\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\nmissing_data &lt;- africadata |&gt; #by year, count number of NAs AKA missings\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  summarize(missing = sum(is.na(infant_mortality)))\n\nggplot(data=missing_data, aes(x=year, y=missing)) + #make a bar plot to easily see when/where the NAs are\n  geom_col()\nTo avoid missingness, lets’ pull only rhe data from 2000.\nafricadata2000 &lt;- africadata |&gt; #pull out year 200 only\n  filter(year==2000)\n\nggplot(data=africadata2000, aes(x=infant_mortality, y=life_expectancy, col=country)) + #make same plots as above, but only usiing year 2000\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=africadata2000, aes(x=population, y=life_expectancy, col=country)) +\n  geom_point()\nFinally, I fit two simple linear models to the 2000 data, life expectency explained by infant mortality and then by population. Using alpha=0.05 as a cutoff, I will assume the null hypotheses to be each predictor is not associated with life expectancy. With a p-value of 2.83e-08, we reject the null hypothesis to conclude that infant moratlity is a significant predictor of life expectancy in African countries in 2000. With a p-value of 0.616, we fail to reject the null hypothesis to conlcude that population is not a significant predictor of life expectency in African countries in 2000.\nfit1 &lt;- lm(data=africadata2000, life_expectancy~infant_mortality)\nfit2 &lt;- lm(data=africadata2000, life_expectancy~population)\n\nsummary(fit1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africadata2000)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-22.6651  -3.7087   0.9914   4.0408   8.6817 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

Fields with fewer applications have higher success rates, possibly due to lower competition. In contrast, disciplines with over 500 applications see success rates drop below 15%, likely due to increased competition for limited funding. One outlier with 800+ applications and the lowest success rate suggests that some fields are highly competitive with stricter selection criteria.\n\n# Scatterplot of Total Applications vs. Success Rate\nggplot(funding_variable_one, aes(x = applications_total, y = success_rates_total)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Applications vs. Success Rate\",\n    x = \"Total Applications\",\n    y = \"Overall Success Rate\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proportion of Female Applicants vs. Gender Success Rate Difference\nThe scatterplot shows no clear correlation between the proportion of female applicants and the gender success rate difference, as points are scattered across both positive and negative values. Some disciplines with higher female representation still exhibit gender disparities in success rates. In certain fields, men have a higher success rate, while in others, women do better, indicating variability across disciplines. This suggests that factors beyond applicant proportion, such as funding policies or selection criteria, may influence gender differences in research funding success.\n\n#Scatterplot Proportion of Female Applicants vs. Gender Success Rate Difference\nggplot(funding_variable_two, aes(x = proportion_women_applicants, y = success_rate_difference)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Female Applicants vs. Gender Success Rate Difference\",\n    x = \"Proportion of Female Applicants\",\n    y = \"Success Rate Difference (Men - Women)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Top Disciplines Based on Total Applications\n\n# Extracting the top disciplines based on total applications\ntop_disciplines &lt;- fundingdata %&gt;%\n  select(discipline, applications_total, awards_total, awards_men, awards_women) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(applications_total)) %&gt;%  # Sorting by total applications\n  head(5)  # Displaying top 5 disciplines\n\n# Print the summary table\nprint(top_disciplines)\n\n           discipline applications_total awards_total awards_men awards_women\n1     Social sciences                834          112         65           47\n2    Medical sciences                505           75         46           29\n3          Humanities                396           65         33           32\n4 Earth/life sciences                282           56         38           18\n5  Technical sciences                251           43         30           13\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Total awards By Discipline\n\n# Creating a bar plot for total awards by discipline \nggplot(fundingdata, aes(x = reorder(discipline, awards_total), y = awards_total)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"black\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Awards by Discipline\",\n    x = \"Discipline\",\n    y = \"Total Awards\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate text for better readability"

The negative coefficient (-0.0149) indicates that as the number of applications increases, the success rate decreases, likely due to increased competition.

Document somewhere what inputs each script takes and where output is placed.\nIf scripts need to be run in a specific order, document this.

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/kkdor/Desktop/MADA-WORK/annalisecramer-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
